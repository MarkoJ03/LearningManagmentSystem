# Learning Management System (LMS)

This project is a full-stack **Learning Management System (LMS)** designed for a university setting. It is implemented as a **web application** using **Spring Boot (Java)** for the backend, **Angular** for the frontend, and **MySQL** for the database. The system supports role-based access for students, teachers, administrative staff, and administrators, as well as basic access for unregistered users.

This application was developed in collaboration with teammates using **Git** for version control and task distribution.

---

## ⚙ Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with the following layers:

- **Frontend**: Angular with routing and router-outlet structure
- **Backend**: Spring Boot REST API with DTO mapping and layered service structure
- **Database**: MySQL relational database

---

## 🚀 Backend (Spring Boot)

The backend handles all data operations and exposes RESTful APIs.

### Key Features:
- JWT authentication and role-based authorization
- REST API endpoints for all CRUD operations
- DTO-based data transfer and validation
- XML export functionality
- Management of 45+ entities

---

## 💻 Frontend (Angular)

The frontend is implemented in Angular with a dynamic and responsive interface.

### Modules by Role:
- **Unregistered Users**: Can view public university information, faculties, programs, syllabi, materials...
- **Students**: View current and past subjects, exam registration, academic history, announcements...
- **Teachers**: Edit syllabi, schedule class topics, manage evaluations, student lists...
- **Administrative Staff**: Manage student enrollment, create schedules, issue documents and certificates...
- **Administrators**: Manage all entites.

Routing is handled using `router-outlet` and each user role has its own view with restricted functionality.

## 🗃️ Database (MySQL)

The MySQL database is designed with normalized relational tables and proper foreign key relationships. Schema is auto-generated by Hibernate.

### Contains Tables for:
- Users and roles
- Students and academic records
- Subjects, teachers, and syllabi
- Exam periods, outcomes, evaluations
- Year of study and subject associations
- Other core components such as evaluation instruments, notifications, schedules, library items, and accreditation data and more.
